#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Experimentation
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This experiment contains SR NOR latch. The user has to verify its outputs by the inputs entered by the user at all the possible combination of inputs. The user also have to verify the stored values in SR latch as it used as a storing element.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Study and understand the concept of NOR gate latch. <br> | Display the simulator window for latch with previously stored values.  <br> | To perform experiment on a latch. 
2.| Enter binary i/p and corresponding o/p based on your knowledge about that latch and click on “Check” to check your answer. Moreover check the stored values in RS latch. <br>  |  Input and Output will be added to table with corresponding remarks and the output values will stored in latch if they are correct.<br>  | To check the knowledge of operation of latch.
3.| Click on “Reset” button.  <br> | Clear all the input and Output Fields. <br> |  To provide space for further entries.
